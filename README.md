Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is the process we follow when designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications. It ensures that software  are reliable, scalable, 
  and meets user needs. The reasons why software engineering is important in the technology industry are.
   -software engineering helps us create high-quality software that businesses and people rely on.
   - It improves efficiency by following best practices and standards.
   - It ensures softwares are secure and can handle large amounts of data and users.
     
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  - In the 70 structured Programming was invented which introduced better ways to write and organize code.
  - In 2001 Agile development methodology was introduced making software development more flexible and customer-focused.
  - in 1968 Software Engineering was born where the term was introduced at a conference to solve software development problems.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   - Planning. This is where we try understanding what the software should do.
   - Requirement Analysis involves gathering details about what users need.
   - Design is the phase where we creating a blueprint of the software.
   - Implementation phase is where we do the actual code writing.
   - Testing phase is where we check for errors and fixing them.
   - Deployment pase is the stage where we avail the software to users.
   - Maintenance is a continuous process where we fix issues arrising or een updating the software adding features after release.
     
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
   - Waterfall method involves a step-by-step approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next while 
   Agile development methodology is a flexible approach where development happens in small cycles with constant feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
   - A Software Developer is responsible for writing and and also test code during development to build software applications.
   - Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer is responsible for testing the software to find bugs and ensure quality.
   - A Project Manager will plan and oversees the development process ensuring that the project stays on schedule.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
   - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are tools that help us developers write, test, and debug code more easily. For example Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA and 
    also pycharm.
   - Version Control Systems (VCS) helps us keep track of the changes we make in code and also allow multiple people to work together as a froup. For example Git, GitHub 
    which we are using in this plp prgram.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
   - Tight Deadlines is a common challenge to us developers. We can use Agile methods to break work into smaller tasks.
   - Bug Fixing is another issue that takes alot of time in development. We can try writing clean code and do regular testing or even use ai tools to locate bugs in our code.
   - Keeping Up with Technology is another issues considering that technology is always evolving and each and every day we have something new. Continuously learn new skills 
     and tools can help us developers stay updated.
     
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
   - Unit Testing is where we tests individual parts of the software e.g methods/functions.
   - Integration Testing ensures that different parts of the software work together.
   - System Testing aims at testing the entire software to check overall functionality.
   - Acceptance Testing ensures that the software meets customer requirements, test is done by the user and gives feedback.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
   - Prompt engineering is the practice of writing clear and specific instructions for AI models to get better responses. It helps users interact effectively with AI tools 
     like ChatGPT, gemini, copilot, deepseek and others.
     
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
   - An example of a vague Prompt is "Tell me about cars."
   - And the improved Prompt is "Explain the advantages and disadvantages of electric cars compared to gasoline cars."
     The second prompt is more clear and the answer is more likely to be useful.
